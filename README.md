# Interior Designer AI

## Project Structure
This project is an AI-powered furniture interior designing system that generates customized designs based on user input. It integrates Replicative API for generating designs, with a React.js front-end and a Node.js/Express.js backend. Users can upload images, take a quiz for design preferences, view 3D renders of furniture, and provide ratings for the designs.
